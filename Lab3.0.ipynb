If an offer to polygraph or even concerned review of polygraph results shocks a complainant into thinking her lies have been uncovered, the recantation is still perfectly valid.  If you know you are telling the truth, you will argue with machine or investigator.

In all followups the recanted version of events matched what the accused said happened.\n",

      "As for your claims of \"\"stalking\"\", that is absolute rubbish and serves only to aggravate the situation. I have assumed good faith (and good intentions) on your part, and have never suggested (or seen reason to suggest) that you might have some ulterior motive in mass-adding links to one specific company's web page. Nor, for that matter, have I ever made any suggestion that this is an \"\"administrative\"\" matter or even mentioned such a role. (Clearly, as a party to this disagreement, I would not do so at any rate as it would be a conflict of interest.) I would ask that you thus extend the same good faith toward me, rather than making spurious and unfounded accusations. ''''''chatspy \n",

      "\"::::Jmabel; in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims \"\"despite \"\"Third Way\"\" rhetoric, fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a right-wing force\"\"? As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all. The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a \"\"Third Way\"\" as the references show.\n",

This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books. For example, even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism, and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy, Renzo De Felice doesn't try to \"\"cover up\"\" its socialistic origins and third way status. This is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on Mussolini. -   \n",
